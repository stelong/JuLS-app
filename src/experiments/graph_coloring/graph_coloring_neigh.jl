    GraphVariableSampler <: VariableSampler

A variable sampler for graph-based problems that selects connected or nearby nodes.

# Fields
- `adjacency_matrix::BitMatrix`: Binary adjacency matrix representing the graph structure

# Description
The GraphVariableSampler implements a neighborhood-based sampling strategy for graph coloring
problems. It selects variables (nodes) that are connected or close to each other in the graph,
promoting more effective local search moves.

# Sampling Strategy
1. Randomly selects a starting node from available nodes (masked)
2. Iteratively adds nodes by:
   - Preferentially selecting from unvisited neighbors of already selected nodes
   - If no neighbors available, randomly selects from remaining unvisited nodes
3. Continues until reaching desired number of variables
